\section{Introduction}

Black hole mergers have been confirmed by gravitational wave observations.
GR predicts that the momentum of the gravitational wave must be compensated
by the momentum of the resulting black hole, this translates into 
a black hole kick.

This makes black hole kick a required element into studies of the co-evolution of galaxies and black holes.
This has been provided in the pioneering studies 
\citep{2008ApJ...678..780G}, where the subsequent BH trajectory is followed under the effects of dynamical friction and accretion.
One of the key prediction of these models is the settling time, i.e. the time it takes for the recoiling black hole to return to the center of the galaxy potential. 
This settling timescale is central to understand the statistics of observational effects such as offset AGNs, black hole deficits in some galaxy populations and changes in the normalization of the $M_{BH}-\sigma_{\star}$ relationship \citep{2011MNRAS.412.2154B}.

In this letter we use numerical methods under spherical symmetry to study the impact of the central stellar density on the settling timescale.
We use these results to derive a fitting formula for this timescale in terms of the relevant physical variables.
We foresee that this fitting formula could be implemented in semi-analytic models of galaxy evolution that seek to attain a higher precision in their black hole modelling.

Unless otherwise specified, we use a $\Lambda$-CDM model with a matter density parameter $\Omega_M = 0.309$, $\Omega_\Lambda = 0.6911$, and a baryonic fraction $f_b = 0.156$.

\section{Analytic Estimates}

\section{Numerical Setup}

\subsection{Density Profiles}

We model the galaxy as an spherical system with three components: dark matter, gas and stars \citep{tanaka2009assembly, choksi2017recoiling}. 
We define $M_{h}$ as the total mass of Dark Matter in the system.
The amount of baryonic matter is given by the baryonic fraction parameter ($f_b$), and the mass of stars by the stellar fraction parameter ($f_s$). 
The total stellar mass can be written as  $M_\text{stars}(R_\text{vir}) = f_sf_b M_h$ while the total amount of gaseous mass is $M_\text{gas}(R_\text{vir}) = (1 - f_s)f_bM_h$

\subsubsection{Dark Matter}
The dark matter halo follows a Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile

\begin{equation}
\label{eq: dmdensity}
\rho_\text{DM}(r) = \dfrac{\rho_0^\text{DM}}{\frac{r}{R_s}\left(1 + \frac{r}{R_s}\right)^2}
\end{equation}
%
where $R_s$ is the scale radius.
Considering a concentration parameter dependent on halo mass and redshift, $c(M_\text{DM}, z)$, we express this distance as $ R_s = R_\text{vir}/c(M_\text{DM}, z)$.

The virial radius at a redshift of $z$ is defined by 
\begin{equation}
    R_\text{vir} = \left({\dfrac{M_hG}{100 H(z)^2}}\right)^{1/3}, 
\end{equation}
where $H(z)$ is the Hubble parameter and $M_h$ is the halo mass.

This allows us to express $\rho_0^{\text{DM}}$ as 
\begin{equation}\label{eq: rho0dm}
		\rho_0^\text{DM} = \dfrac{M_h}{4\pi \left(\dfrac{R_\text{vir}}{c(M_h, z)}\right)^3 \left[\ln\left(1 + c(M_h, z)\right) - \dfrac{c(M_h, z)}{1 + c(M_h, z)}\right]}
\end{equation}
		
We follow \cite{choksi2017recoiling} and use the following dependence with the dark matter halo mass:
\begin{equation}
c(M_h, z) = c_0(z)\left(\dfrac{M_h}{10^{13}M_{\odot}}\right)^{\alpha(z)}, 
\end{equation}
%			
with
\begin{equation}
c_0(z) = \dfrac{4.58}{2}\left[\left(\dfrac{1 + z}{2.24}\right)^{0.107} + \left(\dfrac{1 + z}{2.24}\right)^{-1.29}\right],
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
\alpha(z) = -0.0965 \exp\left(-\dfrac{z}{4.06}\right).
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Stars}

We model the stellar density as a Hernquist profile \citep{hernquist1990analytical}:
\begin{equation}\label{eq: sdensity}
\rho_s(r) = \frac{f_sf_bM_h}{2\pi}\frac{ \mathcal{R}_s}{r}\frac{1}{(r + \mathcal{R}_s)^3},
\end{equation}
where $\mathcal{R}_s$ is the stellar scale length.
This distance is related to the half-mass radius as
 $R_{1/2} = \left(1 + \sqrt{2}\right)\mathcal{R}_s$.
In this work we fix the half-mass radius to be $R_{1/2} = 0.01 R_\text{vir}$ 


\subsubsection{Gas}

The gas density profile is  described by 
\begin{equation}\label{eq: rdensity}
				\rho_\text{gas}(r) = \dfrac{\rho_0^\text{gas}}{\left(1 + \dfrac{r}{r_0}\right)^{2.2}}
\end{equation}
for  $r > r_0$ and  $\rho_\text{gas}(r) = \rho_0^\text{gas}$ for $r\leq r_0$.
		
The value of the constant $\rho_0^\text{gas}$ can be expressed as XXXXX
		
\subsection{Equation of motion}

We obtain the BH trajectory by numerically integrating the equation of motion:
\begin{equation}\label{eq: equationMotion}
	\frac{d ^2{\bf r}}{dt^2}= {\bf a}_g + {\bf a}_{\text{DF}} - \frac{\dot{M}_\bullet}{M_\bullet}{\bf r},
\end{equation}
where $M$ is the black hole mass , ${\bf a}_{g}$ is the acceleration term due to the gravitational potential of three matter components, ${\bf a}_{DF}$ is the accelaration due to dynamical friction and $\frac{\dot{M}}{M} {\bf v}$ accounts for the deacceleration due to mass accretion of the black hole \citep{tanaka2009assembly, choksi2017recoiling}.  


To describe dynamical friction by collisionless matter components (dark matter and stars) we follow the standard Chandrasekhar formula \citep{binney2011galactic, madau2004effect, tanaka2009assembly, choksi2017recoiling}.

\begin{equation}\label{eq: df_cl}
	{\bf{a}}_\text{DF}^\text{cl} = -\frac{4\pi G^2}{v^3} M_{\bullet} \rho \ln\Lambda\left({\rm erf}(X) - \dfrac{2}{\sqrt{\pi}}Xe^{-X^2}\right){\bf v}
\end{equation}
where $\rho$ is the total local density of stars and dark matter, $X = v/(\sqrt{2}\sigma)$ and $\sigma $ is the velocity dispersion that we approximate as a constant$\sigma = \sqrt{GM/2R_{vir}}$.
We take the Coulomb logarithm at a nominal value of $\ln\Lambda$=3 but keep in mind that changes in this factor can change the return times.

The expressions describing the dynamical friction from the gas are more involved.
We follow \cite{tanaka2009assembly} and implement a hybrid model for the drag force was proposed in which both subsonic and supersonic velocities are possible. We start with the Mach number definition $\mathcal{M} \equiv {v}/{c_s}$ where 
where $c_s$ is the local sound speed, which depends on local temperature. 
We assume that the entire halo is isothermal at the virial temperature ($T_\text{vir}$), which translates into

\begin{equation}\label{eq: soundSpeed}
c_s = \sqrt{\dfrac{\gamma R}{\mathcal{M}_w}T_\text{vir}} = 
\sqrt{\dfrac{\gamma R}{\mathcal{M}_w}\left(\dfrac{\mu m_p G M_h}{2k_BR_\text{vir}}\right)} 
\approx 0.614 \sqrt{\dfrac{M_h}{R_\text{vir}}}\text{ kpcGyr$^{-1}$},
\end{equation}
%	
where $\mu$ is the value of the mean molecular weight of the gas, $\mathcal{M}_w$) is the mean molar mass, $m_p$ is the proton mass and $\gamma$ is the adiabatic index. 
Approximating the gas to a monoatomic one $\gamma \approx 5/3$, yields the last expression on \autoref{eq: soundSpeed}. 

We then take the gaseous dynamical friction as 
\begin{equation}\label{eq: df_c}
a^\text{c}_\text{DF} = -\dfrac{4\pi G^2}{v^3}M_\bullet\rho_\text{gas}f(\mathcal{M}){\bf {v}},
\end{equation}
%			
with
\begin{equation}
f(\mathcal{M}) = \left\{
\begin{matrix}
0.5\ln\Lambda \left[\erf{\dfrac{\mathcal{M}}{\sqrt{2}}} - \sqrt{\dfrac{2}{\pi}}\mathcal{M}e^{-\mathcal{M}^2/2}\right]& \text{if $\mathcal{M} \leq 0.8$}\\
1.5\ln\Lambda \left[\erf{\dfrac{\mathcal{M}}{\sqrt{2}}} - \sqrt{\dfrac{2}{\pi}}\mathcal{M}e^{-\mathcal{M}^2/2}\right] & \text{if $0.8 < \mathcal{M} \leq \mathcal{M}_{eq}$}\\
0.5\ln\left(1 - \mathcal{M}^{-2}\right) + \ln\Lambda & \text{if $\mathcal{M} > \mathcal{M}_{eq}$}
\end{matrix}
\right.
\end{equation}
%
where $M_{eq}$ is the mach number that solves the following equation.
\begin{equation}\label{eq: machEq}
\ln\Lambda\left[1.5\left(\erf{\dfrac{\mathcal{M}}{\sqrt{2}}} - \sqrt{\dfrac{2}{\pi}}\mathcal{M}e^{-\mathcal{M}^2/2}\right) - 1\right] - 0.5\ln\left(1 - \mathcal{M}^{-2}\right) = 0.
\end{equation}
			
Numerically solving \autoref{eq: machEq}, yields $M_{eq} \approx 1.731$ for a value of the Coulomb logarithm $\ln\Lambda = 2.3$. 

To summarize, the full acceleration due to dynamical friction is given by the sum of the noncollisional drag on \autoref{eq: df_cl} and \autoref{eq: df_c}.
		
\subsection{Accretion onto the black hole}
			
			
We describe the BH growth by accretion assuming the Bondi-Hoyle-Littleton 

\begin{equation}
	\dot{M}_\bullet^\text{BHL} = \dfrac{4\pi G^2 \rho_GM^2_\bullet}{\left(c_s^2 + v^2\right)^{3/2}},
\end{equation}
%
Where $\rho_G$ corresponds to the gas density. We use the Eddington rate as the upper limit for the accretion rate,
\begin{equation}
	\dot{M}_\bullet^\text{Edd} = \dfrac{(1 - \epsilon)M_\bullet}{\epsilon t_\text{Edd}},
\end{equation}
%
with $\epsilon = 0.1$ and $t_\text{Edd} = 0.44 \text{ Gyr}$.
			
\subsection{Initial conditions and numerical integration}

The initial inputs for the simulation are the redshift $z_{init}$, the dark matter halo virial mass at that redshift $M_{h}$ and the initial speed for the black hole $v_{init}$. 
The halo is kept fixed through the simulation. Cosmological acceleration is ignored at all times as it has been found that it only marginally affects black hole orbits \citep{choksi2017recoiling}. 

We carry out the numerical integration  using a leapfrog scheme in the REBOUND library with a timestep fixed to 1000 years.
The simulation steps when the system destabilizes and starts gaining energy, due to singularities at $x \rightarrow 0$ and $\dot{x} \rightarrow 0$, or if they simply last more than the age of the universe. 
		
We define the return time as the time required by the black hole to orbit with maximum distances of less than  $0.01R_\text{vir}$.
		

\section{Results}

We start with an illustrative result of a BH orbit that started at $z=10$ with $v=25$ km/s in a dark matter halo of $10^{10}\Msun$.
